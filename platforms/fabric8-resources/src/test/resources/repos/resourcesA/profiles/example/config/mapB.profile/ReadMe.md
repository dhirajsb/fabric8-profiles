# Example ConfigMap

This profile makes it easy to automatically create ConfigMaps in Kubernetes/OpenShift.

The idea is that you can add to the wiki deployment configurations with ConfigMaps that can be shared in a hierarchical fashion.

This means as you change the profile and all children profiles get updated, or override configuration in a child profile.
